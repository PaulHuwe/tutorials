    "### Important Background Material\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key aspects of ASDF are the tools it provides to validate that the ASDF\n",
    "file is correct. How does an ASDF library use these tools to know what is correct?\n",
    "ASDF files can be associated with files that define expectations for the file. \n",
    "Besides the obviousl requirement that the yaml be correctly formatted yaml, ASDF\n",
    "makes use of associated files called \"schema\" files and any ASDF library uses these to\n",
    "check the validity of a file, either in reading from or in writing to an ASDF file. \n",
    "Normally these expectations are provided by the tags a file contains (but currently\n",
    "JWST uses a different approach). Usually tags have corresponding \"schema\" files.\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly is a schema file? It is a yaml-formatted\n",
    "that contains rules for what is expected of the content associated with the tag\n",
    "that identifies the content. It contains what attributess are expected and the\n",
    "types of values they are expected to have (these types may themselves be other tags).\n",
    "This tutorial will not go into the details of these schemas (how to interpret and \n",
    "write schemas for custom content will be the subject of a different tutorial).\n",
    "If the library encounters a file that violates these rules, an error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "This checking is called validation and it is by default, performed when reading\n",
    "ASDF files, as well as writing content to them. Validation can significantly \n",
    "affect the performance of reading and writing ASDF files, so it can be turned off\n",
    "in either case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How errors occur\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways errors or warnings may arise. Here are common reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The needed library to deal with a tag is not installed. This usually results in a\n",
    "  warning (depending on the read options selected). When a tag is encounterd that\n",
    "  does not have a registered library to deal with it, the content is generally \n",
    "  read in as basic Python dicts and lists, but no conversion to a special Python\n",
    "  object is done.\n",
    "- The version of the tag is not supported by the version of the library. This \n",
    "  also usually results in a warning, and no conversion to an object is \n",
    "  performed.\n",
    "- The content of the file does not satisfy the rules of the schema file associated\n",
    "  with a particular tag.\n",
    "- The yaml itself has syntax errors. This normally should not occur when the file\n",
    "  is generated by the ASDF library, but if someone has edited the yaml content\n",
    "  by hand, they may have introduced syntax errors.\n",
    "- Or, our favorite, there is a bug in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnosing errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you get errors while validiation is off, **the very first thing you should do \n",
    "  is load (or write) the file with validation on.** The resulting errors when that \n",
    "  is not turned on may be very mysterious and not indicate the root problem.\n",
    "- If the errors message indicates that there is a version problem, \n",
    "Currently in the Python library,\n",
    "depending on the type of error, the traceback message may be confusing or\n",
    "misleading. "
